In this video I run Claude Code's new Dynamic Workflows feature to spin up 1000 AI agents on one task, completely free, using local models in LM Studio instead of the paid Anthropic API. I walk through the full setup start to finish: the Claude desktop Gateway, loading a local Gemma model, the alias trick that makes Claude find it, adding web search with an MCP, and firing a /deep-research workflow that runs hundreds of autonomous agents on your own computer. Works with Ollama and cloud models like OpenRouter too, but the whole point is you can run Claude Code agents locally for $0.

## Transcript

**0:00** · Hello legends. In this video, I'm going to show you how to use the new Claude dynamic workflows feature, which lets you generate up to 1,000 agents to work on really complicated tasks. And instead of us using the paid API from Anthropic or even needing an Anthropic account, I'm going to show you how to do this by using local AI models that are running completely on your computer. Now, this is possible because we're using the gateway version for Claude. The gateway version is still an official Claude product. It's literally the Claude desktop app, which we get access to the Claude code and the Claude co-work.

**0:29** · But by using the gateway, we're able to plug into any LLM, so we can either use something like LM Studio, which we're going to be doing in this video, to download and use local models directly with Claude co-work and Claude code, or we can connect up to something like Open Router, which has got access to hundreds of cloud-based models. Some are free, some are paid, but even the paid ones you will save like nine just over 98% to get really, really good models that you can use.

**0:57** · To get this working, what we need to do is just read the documentation on a thing called co-work on 3P. Once again, that's just the version of Claude desktop app that lets you plug into a gateway. So, we're just going to go across to this documentation. So, over here we can see run co-work against your own cloud inference provider or in our case, our own local inference provider. And I'm just going to go into the next steps to figure out how to install and set this up. So, our first step is to download the Claude desktop app. If you don't already have this, just click this button and then download the desktop app for yourself. Works on a Mac and Windows, so just download and install.

**1:29** · Once you're done with that, the step two is uh explicitly stated, do not sign in or do not create an Anthropic account because once again, you don't need to have an account or to be using the Claude API to make this work. And once your app is open on your screen, you just go into the top left-hand corner if you're on Mac OS and click on help, drop down to troubleshooting and then uh enable developer mode. Once you enable developer mode, in that same top menu bar, you see a new menu button called developer. Once you drop that down, you'll see configure third-party inference.

**1:59** · When you open the configure third-party inference settings, you have an option to choose the connection type.

**2:06** · We're just going to leave it as gateway, and uh we have credential kind. We'll drop down, we'll select static API key.

**2:12** · Now, in this video, I'm just going to show you how to do it with LM Studio, or this would also work if you have Ollama, and it also works if you're using Open Router. So, if you want a follow-up video for Open Router, just let me know below.

**2:24** · For the gateway base URL, we're going to get that directly from LM Studio, and then we'll come back to the API key and figure out our credential type. So, if you haven't heard of LM Studio, I'm going to drop a video somewhere on the screen right now that'll give you a full run-through, especially if you're brand new to this tool. But, essentially, it's a free desktop app that you can download onto your computer, and you can browse free local AI models, and then download them onto your device, and then you can use them either directly in the app like a chat mode, or you can plug them into different tools like Hermes or Open Claw or an arcade into Claude.

**2:54** · Now, you can download LM Studio for Mac and Windows, so it's going to run for both operating systems. So, once you open up LM Studio, you're going to see a window like this.

**3:04** · Now, there's three things we need to do here. The first is we need to download a model so that we can then plug it into Claude. The second is we need to get ourselves this gateway base URL, so that's going to be in the settings in LM Studio. Then, the final thing is when you download a model, it's actually just living in your like storage. It's technically asleep on your computer. In order for it to be useful, we need to wake it up and just kind of keep it turned on. So, I'm going to show you how to do that as well. So, now the first thing we want to do is just download one of these local models.

**3:29** · So, we're just going to go to model search, and now this tab, everything on the left-hand side, these are all free local models that you can download. Just be mindful as you're browsing the model, if you get a red warning that says likely too large, it just means it's too big to run on your computer, and you want to just find a different model. We're going to get a green tick like this. So, the Gemma E4B and the E2B are fantastic models. They're very small, and they're really good for like a gentic tasks.

**3:54** · Pretty much what we want to do in co-work. And as you can see I got a green tick saying full GPU offload possible. And in that case, I would just download this model.

**4:03** · So the next thing you want to do is click on to settings. Open up the settings panel, go across to developer, and then you want to turn this setting on. So by default, if it's your first time using LM Studio, it's going to be turned to off. Developer mode will be off. You just want to flick it across to on. Then you can close this panel and you should see a new menu bar over here called developer. Now when you open up developer, this is the access where we can manage our our model. We're able to get our model, load it up into memory so it's awake, and then by using this URL, this is the gateway URL, we can actually plug this directly into Claude.

**4:35** · So as you can see here, I've got a bunch of loaded up models. They're not all of the models that I have on my computer. These are just the ones that are awake and ready to do some work. Now while we're here, I'm just going to delete this model here. I mean I'm not going to delete it. I'm just going to put it back to sleep. It says Claude Opus 4.6. We'll come back to this. I actually don't have a Claude model on my computer, but that's important for us to know in just a second. I'm going to copy this URL, and let's paste it into this gateway base URL. And now we need an API key.

**5:03** · Since I'm doing this locally using my local LM Studio, I want to put a default value of LM-Studio.

**5:10** · Leave it as bearer, and for now let's just test the connection. So scrolling down, the gateway returned no usable models. Which is a little bit strange because I actually in LM Studio, I've got two models that are actually loaded up and they're ready to go. But the one caveat is that the desktop app is actually searching to see what your model alias is, or like what the actual model name is. In my case, I've got a Gemma and a Minimax, and Claude is only looking for things that have Sonnet or Opus or Haiku.

**5:38** · So in this case, none of the models that we have will have this will have this convention. So what you can do to bypass that issue is when you're loading up your model, which means you're taking it from sleeping to awake, I'm just going to go through some of these models here. I've got my Gemma 4 26B. When I click this, now I'm in the settings panel to basically wake this up and configure the settings. I can get this API identifier. I'm just going to backspace this. I'm going to type in Claude Opus uh 4.8.

**6:09** · And uh for me, I just want to get my context window to be as big as possible.

**6:13** · Once again, watch that instructional video, all this kind of stuff will make sense. Most important part is that you want to have Claude Opus 4.6 and now we can load our model. So, as we see, we're going to be loading our model and it's got this convention here, 4.8, but we just want to confirm it's the Gemma model, but it's going to be uh identified as Opus 4.8. So, now if we come back to our settings and let's just test model discovery. There we go, one model found. So, we're just kind of refresh everything. We found the model, everything's fine.

**6:43** · We found the Opus 4.8. So, now before I save these settings and apply anything here, the one final thing that I want to do is when I'm using the paid API service from Claude, part of the tools, part of the built-in tools that we get are things like web fetch and web search. So, when you're using Claude in a desktop app or on a on a web or whatever and you ask it a question to like search the internet for some something or whatever, it's already built in, that web search is built in. But since we're using our local models, we don't have built-in web search.

**7:11** · We'll have to introduce an MCP, basically like a connection that we can search the web by ourselves. So, this disable built-in tools just means that the model's never going to call this, it's just going to look for MCP connections. Uh once again, because our local model doesn't have this. So, I'm going to go to apply changes, save and restart. And now, if this is your first time using Claude and you didn't have the desktop app open or signed in, you will see this window. But if you are already using Claude and you were already signed in before starting this process, you're not going to see this window. All you need to do is just sign out.

**7:43** · Just open up your Claude uh the desktop app and just sign out of it and then you'll be able to see this screen.

**7:48** · Now, we still have two ways to sign in, so the first way is using Claude.ai, so our paid subscription, which we don't lose that privilege even if we do this third-party LLM provider, or we can do what we want to do here, which is use our local model. So, I'm going to click on continue and here we go. Let me just drop down. I can see my Opus 4. I'm in co-work right now, but I want to get across to Claude Code. Now, before we actually fire off our agents, I want to make sure that we have internet search plugged in. I've already configured Brave Search MCP and I'm going to show you how to do the same thing.

**8:16** · So, to do this, we're just going to go into this gateway settings button, click on settings, just go across to developer, and we're going to click on edit configuration. And then you want to open the configuration file. And once you open your file, you see a bunch of different settings inside that file.

**8:32** · They all relate to your Claude desktop app configuration. You will not see this. I have an MCP server plugged in, which is the Brave Search. Now, you can actually use whatever provider that you want to use. Most providers online will have an MCP connection. All you need to do is just Google, you know, Brave Search MCP or Firecrawl MCP, whatever you want to use. Scroll down until you find the NPX install. This is what we need to get the MCP plugged in.

**8:57** · You can now copy this, then copy everything that is in this configuration file, and just go across to a new Claude session and paste in the MCP settings, paste in the configuration file that you had, and then ask Claude to combine those two together. Once you uh get it combined, you can take the output and just paste it into your configuration file.

**9:15** · And then as you go through and you want to find different connectors, like you want to use a ClickUp MCP or uh I don't know, a Gmail MCP, whatever is available, you can then keep coming back into this Claude session, plug in uh give the new MCP and then ask Claude to add it for you. Now, just be mindful for the Brave Search, you are going to have to have an API key. So, in this case, just sign up, create a new account, and then generate a new API key. And then once you're done, you'll be able to see your Brave Search as an option on your on your connectors. Just make sure that it's turned on.

**9:44** · And then the final thing we want to do is figure out how to create those hundreds of agents to do work for us. And you can do that by using a new feature called dynamic workflows. So, this was released a few days ago with Opus 4.8. A dynamic workflow is a JavaScript that lets you basically deploy hundreds of sub agents. Now, the specifics are around this are you can have up to 16 concurrent agents. So, 16 agents working at one time, and a total of 1,000 agents per run.

**10:12** · So, let's say you have a big project, you have an office, you can have 16 employees working in that office at any one time.

**10:20** · Let's say this whole project takes you 5 hours. Across that 5 hours, you would have had 1,000 people come through doing work at different times. So, yeah, at any one time it's 16, but a total per task is 1,000. And then inside Claude Code, we have a slash command, which is deep research, and this is already a bundled workflow. So, as long as we use this slash command, Claude's already going to know to basically generate hundreds of agents for the task. So, back in Claude, I'm just going to use the slash command, find deep research, and then paste in the command that I used before.

**10:52** · I'm basically saying, "Hey, I want to start a local AI agency in Australia.

**10:57** · Find my 10 competitors. Find 10, you know, types of customers that are looking for these services, and then build me a business plan around this."

**11:03** · Now, as you can see here, this is literally real-time processing. I'm using my M3 Ultra with 512 gigs of RAM, and I'm using the Gemma 26B. It's a small model. It doesn't have a lot of strain from my MacBook from my M3 Studio. But, at a very high level when using local AI models, there's two main components to be able to get a response.

**11:22** · The first is prefill. So, like how fast can your model intake the prompt that you're sending it? Um and then you have the coding, which is how fast your model can generate a response. The Mac Studio is pretty fast at generating responses, but it's a little bit slow at ingesting and kind of like processing the prompt.

**11:39** · Plus, since we're using Claude, this is like um yeah, there's a lot of tokens that are already pre-built basically from the very first message we're sending like 30,000 tokens. It's a lot. But then from here you can literally just leave your computer, you can come back in 1 or 2 hours, and then you would have had, you know, a couple of hundred agents do a bunch of work for you. All right, guys, thank you very much for watching this video. If you enjoyed it, I'd appreciate it if you could like the video, drop a comment, or subscribe to my channel. And if you'd like to see a follow-up of me plugging into Open Router so that you can run free cloud models or really, really cheap paid cloud models, let me know in the comments below.

**12:12** · All right, see you in the next one.
